        An identifier for the institution that is responsible for generating
        and providing CORDEX simulations.
        No spaces, dots or underscores are allowed.
        Hyphens are typically used to separate community names from the specific institution performing the run (e.g. COMM-INST), or to separate different institution acronyms partnering to contribute a given simulation (e.g. INST1-INST2).

        `Full name, city, country` of the institution that is responsible for CORDEX simulations.
        A region name (state, province, department, etc.) can be appended in parenthesis to the city name.
        E.g. `Full name, city (region), country`.
        If several institutions are registered as a single provider, use a semicolon to separate their full names and place them into brackets.
        E.g. `INST1 [Full name 1, city1, country1]; INST2 [Full name 2, city2, country2]`
